            <p xml:id="en-ch001-p0001">Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen <anchor xml:id="en-ch01-p001-ch0057"/> having asked me to
               write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the
               end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there
               is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17â€”, and go
               back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow Inn<anchor xml:id="en-ch001-p0001-char0106"/>, and the brown old
               seaman, with the saber-cut, first took up his lodging under our roof. </p>
            <p xml:id="en-ch001-p0002">I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his
               sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow;[3] a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown
               man; his tarry pig-tail[4] falling over the shoulders of his soiled blue coat; his
               hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the saber-cut across one
               cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to
               himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sung so
               often afterward: </p>
